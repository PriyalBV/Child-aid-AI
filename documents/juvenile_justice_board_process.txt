Legal Basis:
Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015

Definition:
The Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) is a judicial body that deals with cases involving **Children in Conflict with Law (CCL)** — i.e., children alleged to have committed a criminal offense under the age of 18.

Board Composition:
- One First Class Judicial Magistrate
- Two social workers (at least one woman)
- Sits in a child-friendly environment (not a regular courtroom)

Key Steps:

1. **Apprehension of the Child**
   - Police must inform the child's parents/guardians and produce the child before the JJB within **24 hours** (excluding travel time).
   - No child is handcuffed, detained in police lockup, or kept with adult offenders.

2. **Preliminary Assessment (for heinous crimes, 16–18 age)**
   - For crimes punishable with 7+ years (e.g., murder, rape), a psychological and social evaluation is done to assess maturity.
   - The Board decides if the child should be tried as an adult or in juvenile justice system.

3. **Social Investigation Report (SIR)**
   - Prepared by a probation officer or Child Welfare Police Officer (CWPO).
   - Assesses family background, circumstances, education, and behavior.

4. **Inquiry Proceedings**
   - Proceedings are **informal, participatory, and child-friendly**.
   - Witnesses may be called but cross-examination is avoided.
   - The child is never declared “guilty,” but instead “found to have committed the offense.”

5. **Orders that may be passed**
   - Counseling or community service
   - Probation under supervision
   - Placement in Special Home for up to 3 years
   - No capital punishment or life imprisonment without parole can be awarded

6. **Follow-up**
   - Periodic monitoring of rehabilitation measures
   - Education, skill training, and reintegration plans

Important Principles:
- Presumption of innocence
- Right to privacy and legal aid
- Focus on **reformation and rehabilitation**, not punishment
